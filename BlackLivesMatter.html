"We all know that if George Floyd was white, he wouldn't have died."<br>
Say no to a <u><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/police%20state">police state...</a></u><br>
Say no to <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police">police militarization...</a></u><br>
Say no to <u>violent and abborent police oppression and brutality, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/guku9d/save_and_share_this_denver_swat_pushes/">this example of SWAT units pushing a photographer into a fire</a></u><br><br>
This isn't just about racism anymore, all the events that have occured have showed how xenophobia, discriminative nationalism, largely-autonomous and largely-corrupt/brutal police are all in abundant presence among America.<br><br>
The fact that there is people taking advantage of peaceful protests in order to loot, the fact that there is actually people and politicans trying to justify the <u>murder</u> of George Floyd, only shows how much of a problem America truly has in its roots.<br><br>
Right-wing media sources such as <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News">Fox News</a></u> are extremely dangerous, inciting <u>violence</u> against even peaceful protesters and modest journalists, by backing up President Trump in his continued support for increasingly oppressive and authoritarian action against peaceful protests.<br><br>
You know what makes this situation even worse? The fact that the racist, xenophotic, and idiotic president of America is <u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/george-floyd-protests-live-updates.html">encouraging and inciting violence against peaceful protesters himself too.</a></u><br><br>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gug7i4/young_man_gets_arrested_for_exercising_his_first/">Blatant violation of the First Amendment. Guess this is what happens when you increasingly give police more and more autonomy, huh</a><br><br>

Fun fact: law enforcement agencies such as the <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard">National Guard</a></u> tend to be much more peaceful during protests compared to normal police, due to restrictions imposed on the NG by legislation known as the <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice">UCMJ</a></u>, which applies to the NG, and the American military, but <u>not</u> police.<br><br>
